## Developer ##

Feel free to download the source code from "source" and make improvements or studies.
The development is much simpler using netbeans 7.0.x, because the new versions do not come with component layout that was used at the time I did the project.
To generate the jar for distribution, use the ant task in this project (build.xml file):
_other -> package for store_
The full jar will be generated in the "store" folder.
I wish you much success. I believe that each of us can make a contribution to improve the world.
